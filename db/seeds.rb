      we were invited to local pop-up sales. At these pop-ups, we debuted our allergy-conscious baked goods which were sold out in a matter of minutes. The demand
      for our product grew, and in April of 2016 we starting producing our baked goods in our church's commercial kitchen. Baking in a commercial kitchen allowed
      for our baked goods to be sold at restaurants and coffee shops in downtown Grand Rapids. Since then, we have accumulated nine wholesale vendors where our
      customers can buy our baked goods. We fulfill small custom orders for events such as birthday parties and baby showers, as well as larger custom orders

        light-proof box. light passes through this hole, an image is exposed onto the film loaded inside the camera. Exposure times are
        typically longer than with a normal lensed camera, due to the aperture being so much smaller. This means that pinhole cameras can
        typically take anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to expose a photograph. Because of these long exposures the shutter
        is usually manually operated. It strips complex photographic concepts down to their basic foundation: Light. How much to let in,
